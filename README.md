# A c program a day keeps depression away!

Just like "a drawing every day" projects, but for people who can't draw.

## Rules
- Every day, a small programming project written in c must be committed
- The code has to be written in a single day
- Old projects can not be modified after the day has passed
- COMMENTS!
- Before committing, the current project must be added to the shared makefile
